# Iterative-Text-Refinement-System
DSA project demonstrating circular linked list–based zonal text refinement for text documents. 

📌 Overview:
The Zonal Text Refinement System is a Python-based project that demonstrates the effective use of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in optimizing text processing tasks.

Unlike traditional approaches that repeatedly process the entire text, this system divides the input into **logical zones** and processes only the zones that actually require refinement.

---

## 🎯 Objectives:
- Apply **Circular Linked Lists** in a real-world application  
- Avoid redundant processing of already-correct text  
- Improve computational efficiency  
- Visually demonstrate linked list traversal and refinement  

---

## 🧩 Data Structure Used:
Circular Linked List
Each node represents a **text zone**:
- Introduction
- Body
- Conclusion

The circular structure enables:
- Continuous traversal
- Efficient revisiting of only unrefined zones
- Early termination once all zones are refined
